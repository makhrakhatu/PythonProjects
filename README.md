First md file made for testing purpose.
Attach files by dragging and dropping.

In the simplest terms:

--soft: uncommit changes, changes are left staged (index).
--mixed (default): uncommit + unstage changes, changes are left in working tree.
--hard: uncommit + unstage + delete changes, nothing left.
